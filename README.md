# Python_Student_Data_Analysis

Project Analysis Overview
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

It imports data, identifies null values, and handles them effectively by filling or removing them.
Insights:
Consider adding comments on the data source and providing sample rows to give context to users.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Includes descriptive statistics, distributions, and data visualization.
Insights:
Include descriptions of each plot, explaining what the insights mean in terms of the dataset.
Add sections for identifying any correlations and outliers in the data.
Modeling:

Implements machine learning algorithms with training and testing splits.
Insights:
Detail the metrics used to evaluate each model, such as accuracy, F1 score, or RMSE.
Comment on why each model was chosen and any hyperparameters used.
Conclusion:

Summarizes findings and suggests improvements or areas for further analysis.
Insights:
It would be beneficial to explicitly mention the key insights gained from the model performance.
